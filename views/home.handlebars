    Welcome to the Blood Donation Management Database

    This web portal will allow your Blood Donation Agency to manage its operations by allowing you
    to review your blood banks and its supply of donations and aid in setting up targeted blood drives in
    locations that attract many donors when supplies are low.
    <p class="home-intro">
        This portal is also set up to allow your agency to review requests from hospitals that require amounts of
        specific types of blood.
